There is a big danger with coroutines. What happens when a long-running task, never ends?

Sometimes we are dealing with a task that takes much time to finish. In this case, if this task won't complete, It can affect our UI to freeze.

We have two ways to control this situation in coroutines.

Let them time out:
We can use timeOut functions to make sure the task will finish at a particular time. Otherwise, we get null or an exception for the result and we won't wait for the task to finish.

Cancel them:
In this case, our code must wait for the cancellation request and exit the code once it is received. We can use launch { } for an action and use its "isActive" property. And then, we can use ".cancelAndJoin()" to cancel the job.

Take a look at the time out example: (I prefer time out over canceling because it's more straightforward.)
