Some simple examples for 2D arrays from my dad.
Willrabbitreachcarrot -----> create a 2D array and check if there is a way from Rabbit([0][0]) to Carrot([9][9]). 
Rotate -----> create a 2D array and rotate 180 degrees.
Mazeways -----> create a 2D array and count the ways (Rabbit to Carrot).(notice: rabbit must move right and down (for easier example))
Islandcounter -----> create a 2D array, then fill it with 0 and 1 randomly. Islands are made up of 1.
